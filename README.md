# PolygonSel

This Java Application is used in conjunction with [TactileReader](https://github.com/nikhilaii93/TactileReader) android app. This application can be used to create content for the aforementioned application.

The content that'll be read is first to be provided to the application in terms of transcripts which can then be read by the application. This can be done for standardized texts and the publishing authority can provide the transcripts of the concerned documents to the application.
